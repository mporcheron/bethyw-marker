USE OF GIT
You did not include your .git/ directory, thus you will receive 0 marks for this coursework. You were told multiple times in lectures and in the coursework specification that you must include the .git/ directoryCOMPILATION
Your code compiles without issuing any warnings from the compiler, which is great. You should never be submitting code with errors or warnings, even if the code is incomplete.
